mrtg-maker
========

This shell script helps create the MRTG configuration and index.html file.

---

####It's easy to use:
* Create a file that has a list of all the devices you want to monitor with MRTG. (one per line and including the SNMP community)

Example:
```
	public@192.168.1.1
	public@192.168.1.201
```
* Configure the variables in the mrtg-maker.sh file to fit your setup.
* Run the script and your done.
